# ThELPA: Thornjad's Emacs Lisp Package Archive

This repository is my custom ELPA for maximum control. Primarily used to provide package to [Aero Emacs](https://github.com/thornjad/aero).

## Updating the archive

``` sh
make install-cask  # if you don't already have Cask itself installed
make cask-install  # first time set-up only
make
```

## Testing

``` sh
make test
```
